## phones

### Young people worldwide do most things on the internet from their phones.

# native vs. web
<br />

Native mobile apps clearly are the current winner in web 2.

<br />

A slightly larger swath of **disengaged users** might try a mobile web app first, but the ‚Äústicky‚Äù, **power users** prefer native mobile apps.


---

# when to use native mobile?
<br />

* high frequency
* real time
* low(ish) stakes‚Äîalthough this is changing
* biometric auth
* convenient, reliable, local data persistence required
* uses camera or GPS

# what about censorship?


---
# censorship
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Using **contract-based accounts** (or **WalletConnect**) means that there‚Äôs no loss of funds or ability to use the contracts with the same ‚Äúaccount‚Äù even in the case of censorship.

# scenarios with React Native
<br />

### Apple takedown?
Works on Android
<br />
<br />

### Google takedown?

Works on iOS
<br />
<br />

### Both platforms censored?
**react-native-web** and/or sharing code with a React codebase

# building native mobile dapps
<br />

Let's talk best practices for building a native mobile Ethereum dapp with a simple UX without any decentralization tradeoff.

# onboarding

---
# in-dapp fiat onramps

---
# in-dapp wallets
<br />
<br />

> ### To attract the next wave of Ethereum users, we should assume that users don‚Äôt have a wallet yet.

---
# a single, fluid UX
<br />

Let‚Äôs set them up with their first "wallet‚Äù in the app they want to use instead of kicking them elsewhere to a separate app to set one up before they can get started.
<br />


```js
import { Account } from "tasit-sdk";
const burnerWallet = Account.create();
const { address } = burnerWallet;
console.log(address); // '0x...'
// ...
```



---
# why now?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### In-dapp fiat onramps recently have made this a viable option.


---
# another new account?
<br />

For new users, they don't have another account anyway, and this could evolve into their main account.
<br />
<br />

A new account is better for OPSEC and accounting reasons anyway.

---
# (burner and contract-based)
<br />
<br />
<br />


```js
Account.upgrade(burnerWallet)
```

# ongoing UX

---

# optimistic API
<br />

```js
import { Contract } from "tasit-sdk";

const { NFT } = Contract;

const contractAddress = '0x0E86...333'

const contract = new NFT(contractAddress);

const action = contract.safeTransferfrom(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("enoughConfirmations", successListener);
action.send(); // broadcast

// Do optimistic UI updates immediately, while making sure
// to update the UI again when there are enough
// confirmations for your use case
// ...
```

---

# the graph
<br />
<br />


```js
const action = contract.safeTransferfrom(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("presentInTheGraph", successListener);
action.send(); // broadcast
// ...
```
---

# ENS
---

# meta-transactions
<br />
<br />
<br />

```js
const action = contract.myFavoriteMethod(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("enoughConfirmations", successListener);
action.sendForFree(); // meta-tx broadcast

// ...
```

# dapps are useful
<br />

Dapps already deliver significant value and ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moments to crypto-native ‚Äúinnovators‚Äù in ways that will eventually be useful for mainstream people too.


---
# UX is the problem
<br />

So the only reason (setting the scaling discussion aside for the moment) that there aren‚Äôt lots of users flooding the network yet is that there aren‚Äôt sufficiently simple tools for great web 2 product teams to build native mobile apps for Ethereum dapps.
---
# user interviews
<br />

We're actively doing user interviews to shape which features are prioritized.
