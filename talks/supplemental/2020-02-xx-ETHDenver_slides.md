## phones

<br />

### Young people worldwide do most things on the internet from their phones.

## laptops

### And yet we're building web-based dapps optimized for use on laptops.

# native vs. web

<br />
<br />
<br />

Native mobile apps clearly are the current winner in web 2.

<br />

A slightly larger swath of **disengaged users** might try a mobile web app first, but the ‚Äústicky‚Äù, **power users** prefer native mobile apps.

---

# when to use native mobile?

<br />

- high frequency
- real time
- low(ish) stakes‚Äîalthough this is changing
- biometric auth
- convenient, reliable, local data persistence required
- uses camera or GPS

# what about censorship?

# censorship

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Using **contract-based accounts** (or **WalletConnect**) means that there‚Äôs no loss of funds or ability to use the contracts with the same ‚Äúaccount‚Äù even in the case of censorship.

# scenarios with React Native

<br />

### Apple takedown?

Works on Android
<br />
<br />

### Google takedown?

Works on iOS
<br />
<br />

### Both platforms censored?

**react-native-web** and/or sharing code with a React codebase

# building native mobile dapps

<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's talk best practices for building a native mobile Ethereum dapp with a simple UX without any decentralization tradeoff.

# onboarding

---

# in-dapp fiat onramps

---

# in-dapp wallets

<br />
<br />

> ### To attract the next wave of Ethereum users, we should assume that users don‚Äôt have a wallet yet.

---

# a single, fluid UX

<br />

Let‚Äôs set them up with their first "wallet‚Äù in the app they want to use instead of kicking them elsewhere to a separate app to set one up before they can get started.
<br />

```js
import { Account } from "tasit-sdk";
const burnerWallet = Account.create();
const { address } = burnerWallet;
console.log(address); // '0x...'
// ...
```

---

# why now?

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### In-dapp fiat onramps recently have made this a viable option.

---

# another new account?

<br />

For new users, they don't have another account anyway, and this could evolve into their main account.
<br />
<br />

A new account is better for OPSEC and accounting reasons anyway.

---

# (burner and contract-based)

<br />
<br />
<br />

```js
Account.upgrade(burnerWallet);
```

# ongoing UX

---

# optimistic API

<br />

```js
import { Contract } from "tasit-sdk";

const { NFT } = Contract;

const contractAddress = "0x0E86...333";

const contract = new NFT(contractAddress);

const action = contract.safeTransferfrom(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("enoughConfirmations", successListener);
action.send(); // broadcast

// Do optimistic UI updates immediately, while making sure
// to update the UI again when there are enough
// confirmations for your use case
// ...
```

---

# the graph

<br />
<br />

```js
const action = contract.safeTransferfrom(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("presentInTheGraph", successListener);
action.send(); // broadcast
// ...
```

---

# ENS

---

# meta-transactions

<br />
<br />
<br />

```js
const action = contract.myFavoriteMethod(/*...*/);
action.on("error", errorListener);
action.on("enoughConfirmations", successListener);
action.sendForFree(); // meta-tx broadcast

// ...
```

# wrapping up

---

# dapps are useful

<br />
<br />
<br />

Dapps **already** deliver significant value and ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moments to **crypto-native** ‚Äúinnovators‚Äù in ways that could be useful for mainstream people too if packaged correctly.

---

# UX is the problem

<br />
<br />

## So the only reason (setting the scaling discussion aside for the moment) that there aren‚Äôt lots of users flooding the network yet is that there aren‚Äôt sufficiently simple tools for **great web 2 product teams** to build native mobile apps for Ethereum dapps.

# where to go from here

<br />
<br />

We're actively doing **user interviews** and **developer interviews** to shape which features are prioritized.
