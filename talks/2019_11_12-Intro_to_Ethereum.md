---

## Why Ethereum?

It's what basically all developers use.

---

## This workshop

The markdown file with all of this info we'll be talking about is available at:

[bit.ly/intro-to-ethereum-2019](https://bit.ly/intro-to-ethereum-2019)

Alternatively, you can get here directly via GitHub:

[github.com/pcowgill/talks](https://github.com/pcowgill/talks)

In this workshop, let's get acquainted with the different components of the crypto / web3 stack and the current state of blockchain technology by using some tools from the Ethereum ecosystem.

---

## Any questions?

Feel free to interrupt me at any time. Freeform / real-time questions work best for me.

Or if you're feeling shy, we can crowdsource questions online. Go to [sli.do](https://www.sli.do/) and enter the event code `#northwestern-ethereum`. I'll stop to check for the most upvoted questions at some point during the workshop.

### Set up a wallet

While there are lots of choices for wallets, it will be the simplest if you all use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for today.

I'll send you all testnet ETH shortly using the [testnet version](https://testflight.apple.com/join/r9q5stIb) of the [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/) (a different Ethereum wallet that has cool features like account recovery).

There are lots of other great alternatives that we won't have time to try out today including: [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz), [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/), [Status](https://status.im/), and [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/).

---

### Get test Ether

**`{ Walk around scanning QR codes to send ETH on the Rinkeby testnet }`**

- While you wait, jump down below to the [Explore the blockchain](#explore-the-blockchain) section.

### Explore the blockchain (pt. 1)

- Viewing the transactions we just made in the `Get test ether` section on [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1ae4455438316a80E93e1Bb1F6EEbF049eb2A0fB)

- Sending Ether between each other **`{ see next slide }`**

### Room for improvement

**`{ Discuss which tools so far have room for improvement }`**

Let's have an open discussion of observations about the state of the tooling you all have used so far today, what was missing, what could be done better, etc.

This (hopefully) will give you an understanding of how young this ecosystem is and what you could do to push it forward.

---

### Nodes / clients

The [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) node: a client that helps to run the Ethereum blockchain, accept transactions, and advance the state of the chain.

[geth docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started)

    Full: Downloads all blocks (including headers, transactions and receipts) and generates the state of the blockchain incrementally by executing every block.
    Fast (Default): Downloads all blocks (including headers, transactions and receipts), verifies all headers, and downloads the state and verifies it against the headers.
    Light: Downloads all block headers, block data, and verifies some randomly.

`{ Perhaps also discuss Parity and Nimbus }`

[Nimbus](https://nimbus.status.im/)

### Developing smart contracts

A project set up on [studio.ethereum.org](https://studio.ethereum.org/5dcb1bb026b473001233da59?openFile=README.md)

### Why is this important

1. [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/naval/status/877467629308395521) with a historical perspective on governance by Naval Ravikant
1. [AI -> tyranny, blockchain -> democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/yuval-noah-harari-technology-tyranny/568330/)
1. [The Truth Machine](https://smile.amazon.com/Truth-Machine-Blockchain-Future-Everything/dp/1250114578/)
1. [Social justice](https://medium.com/swlh/crypto-for-activism-four-models-of-protest-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-61ca5d07ac47)
1. [Social good](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-for-Social-Good-Chicago/)
1. [Podcast episode about why decentralization matters](https://www.breaker.audio/a16z/e/35542740)
1. [Toy markets](https://blog.ycombinator.com/toy-markets/)
1. Zero platform risk -> the great unbundling of front end and back end (and of individual front end features). Users get "right to exit" meaning that they can elect to use alternative clients without losing all of their data and the network effect of the platform, and the tech tycoons of the future can't prevent them from doing so.

### Privacy

If time allows, we will discuss privacy on Ethereum and how other blockchains incorporate it as a first-tier feature.

We'll also discuss how private technologies like zero-knowledge proofs could be introduced to the Ethereum blockchain in the future.
