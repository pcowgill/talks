## Any questions?

Feel free to interrupt me at any time. Freeform / real-time questions work best for me.

Or if you're feeling shy, we can crowdsource questions online. Go to [sli.do](https://www.sli.do/) and enter the event code `#8th-light-ethereum`. I'll stop to check for the most upvoted questions at some point during the workshop.

### What to expect

1. **Explore:** [Explore](#explore) some data on the blockchain visually.
1. **Why:** Hear a few arguments for [why](#why) this tech/movement matters.
1. **Dapps:** Try out a couple of particularly useful [dapps](#dapps) (decentralized apps) together.
1. **Gas:** Receive an introduction to the concept of [gas](#gas).
1. **Reading and writing:** Learn about good practices for [reading and writing](#reading-and-writing) data, indexing data, etc.

## Explore

---

### Set up a wallet

In order for this exploration to be tangibly meaningful, let's set up wallets first.

While there are lots of choices for wallets, it will be the simplest if you all use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for today.

I'll send you all testnet ETH shortly using the [testnet version](https://testflight.apple.com/join/r9q5stIb) of the [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/) (a different Ethereum wallet that has cool features like account recovery).

There are lots of other great alternatives that we won't have time to try out today including: [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz), [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/), [Status](https://status.im/), and [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/).

---

### Get test Ether

**`{ Walk around scanning QR codes to send ETH on the Rinkeby testnet }`**

- You can view the transactions we're making on [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x1ae4455438316a80E93e1Bb1F6EEbF049eb2A0fB)

---

### Explore the blockchain

- Subscribe for notifications of transactions involving a certain address on **Etherscan**.

---

##### Other UIs

Here are some alternatives to Etherscan:

- [Blockscout](https://blockscout.com)
- [Alethio](https://aleth.io/)
- [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) (although the scope of this product is a bit different)
- [ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/)

## Why

---

### Why Ethereum?

Why cover this through the lens of Ethereum?

**Developer network effect**

---

### Why is this important

1. [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/naval/status/877467629308395521) with a historical perspective on governance by Naval Ravikant
1. [AI -> tyranny, blockchain -> democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/yuval-noah-harari-technology-tyranny/568330/)
1. [The Truth Machine](https://smile.amazon.com/Truth-Machine-Blockchain-Future-Everything/dp/1250114578/)
1. [Social justice](https://medium.com/swlh/crypto-for-activism-four-models-of-protest-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-61ca5d07ac47)
1. [Social good](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-for-Social-Good-Chicago/)
1. [Podcast episode about why decentralization matters](https://www.breaker.audio/a16z/e/35542740)
1. [Toy markets](https://blog.ycombinator.com/toy-markets/)
1. Zero platform risk -> the great unbundling of front end and back end (and of individual front end features). Users get "right to exit" meaning that they can elect to use alternative clients without losing all of their data and the network effect of the platform, and the tech tycoons of the future can't prevent them from doing so.

## Dapps

---

`{ TODO: Cut down this list to more clearly separate dapps we'll try versus a quick overview of the landscape. }`

---

### Wallets

The wallets you set up earlier are a prerequisite for using these dapps.

_(Note: Hopefully that won't be the case in the future.)_

---

### Vanilla transactions
