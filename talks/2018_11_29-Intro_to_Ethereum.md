Who am I?

This is a workshop. Let's get acquainted with the different components of the crypto / web3 stack and the current state of blockchain technology by using some tools from the Ethereum ecosystem.

What to expect:

1. [Set up a wallet](#set-up-a-wallet)
1. [Get test ethet](#get-test-ether)
1. [Explore the blockchain](#explore-the-blockchain)
1. [Gas](#gas)
1. [Collectibles](#collectibles)
1. [Other decentralized applications](#other-decentralized-applications)

They’ll set up a wallet, get test Ether for it, and be guided through a wide array of decentralized applications, transacting between other people in the room, an

We’ll have each student download metamask to access their unique wallet. Then, we’ll guide them through the following:

### Set up a wallet

You should all use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for today.

I'll be sending you testnet ETH using the [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/).

There are lots of other great alternatives that we won't have time for today.

- [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz)

- [BRD](https://brd.com/)

- [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/)

- [Status](https://status.im/)

- [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/)

- [Balance](https://balance.io/)

### Get test Ether

{ Walk around the room scanning QR codes to send ETH on the Rinkeby testnet }

- Viewing the transactions in [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

* Sending Ether between each other

* Let's all send some to one person

### Explore the blockchain

##### Via a UI

- [Alethio](https://aleth.io/)

* [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)

- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics)

* [ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/)

- [scout.cool](https://www.scout.cool/)

- [dappboard](http://dappboard.com/)

- [trivial](https://trivial.co/)

* [Elementus](https://elementus.io/)

##### Programmatically

- [eth.events](https://eth.events/)

* [Graph protocol](https://thegraph.com)

### Gas

- [ETH gas station](https://ethgasstation.info/)

_But it's not just about money..._

### Collectibles

Purchasing a digital collectible and exchanging it with other classmates

- [Vault](https://vault.io/)
- [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)
- [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)
- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) by [Loom Network](https://loomx.io/)

### Other decentralized applications

#### DAOs

Setting up an Aragon DAO

- [Aragon](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/)

##### Stablecoins

Obtaining a stablecoin such as DAI through the MKR contract, transacting it between each other

- [DAI explainer video](https://vimeo.com/247715549)
- [Buy DAI](https://oasis.direct/)

##### Burner wallets

- Play with [xdai.io](https://xdai.io/) to show how burner wallets and meta-transactions can be used to onboard new users into the ecosystem without gas.

### Room for improvement

{ Discuss which tools so far have room for improvement }

We’ll have an open discussion of observations about the state of the tooling the students used, what was missing, what could be done better, etc. This will give students an understanding of how young this ecosystem is and what they could do to push it forward.

### Nodes / clients

We will then show the students a geth node: a client that helps to run the Ethereum blockchain, and how it is able to accept transactions and advance the state of the chain.

### Developing smart contracts

We’ll introduce the students to the Truffle framework for developing smart contracts.

##### ERC standards

`// TODO: Add a link`

##### OpenZeppelin

A library for inheriting from and extending existing smart contract logic.

### Why is this important

`// TODO: Add a link or two`

### Privacy

If time allows, we will discuss privacy and how other blockchains incorporate it as a first-tier feature. We'll also discuss how private technologies like zero-knowledge proofs could be introduced to the Ethereum blockchain in the future.
